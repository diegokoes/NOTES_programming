# CONCEPTSPROTOCOLS >FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING 
*A paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.*

- [Pure Functions](pure_functions.md): Functions without side effects that return the same output for the same input.
- [Immutability](immutability.md): Data structures that cannot be modified after creation.
- [Higher-Order Functions](higher_order.md): Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.
- [Recursion](recursion.md): A technique where functions call themselves to solve problems.
- [Lambda Expressions](lambda.md): Anonymous functions for concise function definitions.
