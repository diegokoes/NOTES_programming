#### **HTTP Request Methods**

HTTP request methods define how a client interacts with a server when making HTTP requests. Here are the six most important HTTP methods:

    GET: The most common method. It retrieves data from the server.
    HEAD: Similar to GET, but only retrieves the headers, not the full response.
    POST: Used to send data to a specific resource, often to create new data.
    PUT: Modifies existing data by sending a full update.
    DELETE: Deletes a resource from the server.
    PATCH: Partially updates a resource by sending only the modified data.

Additional methods like CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE are less common but serve specific purposes, such as establishing tunnels, describing communication options, or tracking request headers.
Comparison: GET vs. POST

    POST is ideal for sending data, such as form submissions or file uploads.
    GET is suitable for retrieving data, allowing users to bookmark URLs with custom filters and preferences.

- **Form submissions** can be either `GET` or `POST`, depending on the `method` specified (default is `GET`).
- **Clicking a link** always generates a `GET` request.
- `POST` is used when you need to **send data to the server** that will modify something (like submitting a form to create a user).
- `GET` is used for **retrieving data** or accessing pages without modifying anything on the server.

The additional sequence of characters appended to the URL is called a **Query String**. The length of the query string is limited to 240 characters. Moreover, the query string is visible on the browser and is called, therefore, a security risk.

- A **socket** in this context is the channel of communication between the client and the server.
- For **`POST` requests**, the server might handle the data sent in separate packets over this socket connection, making it slower compared to `GET`.
- In **`GET` requests**, all the data is included in the URL and sent in one go, making it faster in some cases.
- **`POST`** is more powerful for sending large amounts of data, while **`GET`** is simpler and quicker for smaller data.
#### **HTTP Response Codes**

HTTP response codes are three-digit numbers generated by a server in response to a client's request. They fall into five categories:

    1XX (Informational): The server is processing the request.
    2XX (Success): The request was successfully received and processed.
    3XX (Redirection): The request requires further actions, like a redirection.
    4XX (Client Error): The request contains errors, such as a missing page.
    5XX (Server Error): The server failed to process a valid request.
