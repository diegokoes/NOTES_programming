# Java -> Data Types -> float
## Summary
> [!summary]
> - 32-bit floating-point (IEEE 754)
- Less precision than double

## Theory
float is used where fractional values are required but less precision is acceptable. It's more memory-efficient than double.

## Questions
> [!tip]- When to use float?
> For graphics or data processing where precision isn't critical

> [!warning]- Precision issues?
> Floating-point rounding errors can occur

> [!danger]- Conversions?
> Casting from double to float can lose precision
