# Java -> Data Types -> byte
## Summary
> [!summary]
> - 8-bit signed integer, range: -128 to 127
- Useful for streams or tight memory usage

## Theory
The byte type is often used to save space in arrays or when dealing with raw data like file I/O. It is the smallest integer type in Java.

## Questions
> [!tip]- When should I use byte?
> For efficient memory usage when storing small integers or raw data streams

> [!warning]- Could it overflow?
> Yes, if values exceed -128 or 127

> [!danger]- Why use it over int?
> Primarily for memory constraints or specific byte-level operations
