# JAVA -> DATA TYPES -> DOUBLE
## SUMMARY
> [!summary]
> - 64-bit double-precision floating-point
>- Common default for decimals

## THEORY
double covers a wide range of fractional values with more precision than float. Used for most floating-point calculations by default.

## QUESTIONS
> [!tip]- Why use double?
> Better precision for calculations

> [!warning]- Performance?
> Slightly slower than float in some contexts, but usually negligible

> [!danger]- Overflow and precision loss?
> Still possible with extremely large or repetitive calculations
