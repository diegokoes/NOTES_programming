# Java -> Data Types -> Float
## Summary
> [!summary]
> Float wraps the float primitive, used for single-precision floating-point calculations.

## Theory
Autoboxing converts float to Float automatically. Floats handle decimals but are less precise than doubles. They are typically used in graphics or where memory is constrained.

## Questions
> [!tip]- Why might you use float over double?
> For reduced memory usage when high precision isnâ€™t critical.

> [!warning]- What can happen with floating-point operations?
> Rounding errors and precision loss are common.

> [!danger]- Describe pitfalls of comparing floats directly with ==.
> Floating-point calculations can differ at the bit level, causing inaccuracies.
