## SUMMARY
> [!summary]
> - 32-bit signed integer, range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
- Default integer type

## THEORY
int is widely used for integer arithmetic. It provides enough range for most calculations and is generally the go-to integral type.

## QUESTIONS
> [!tip]- Why is int the default?
> Balances performance and range for typical use cases

> [!warning]- Could operations overflow?
> Yes, exceeding the range leads to wraparound

> [!danger]- When to avoid int?
