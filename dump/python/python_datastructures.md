## MUTABILITY AND IMMUTABILITY

Data Structures can be mutable or immutable. The next question you may ask is, what is mutability? Mutability refers to data inside the data structure that can be modified. For example, you can either change, update, or delete the data when needed. A list is an example of a mutable data structure. The opposite of mutable is immutable. An immutable data structure will not allow modification once the data has been set. The tuple is an example of an immutable data structure.
