# JavaScript -> Basic Syntax -> Variables

## Summary
> [!summary]
>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.
>
>JavaScript is **case-sensitive** and uses the **Unicode** character set. For example, the word FrÃ¼h (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.
## Theory
JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.

var

    Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
let

    Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
const

    Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.
