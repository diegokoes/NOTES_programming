# GIT

## SUMMARY
>
> [!summary]
> Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and coordinates work among multiple developers. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git allows developers to maintain a complete history of their project, work on different features simultaneously through branches, and collaborate efficiently with others. Unlike centralized version control systems, every Git repository contains the full project history, making it resilient and enabling offline work.
