# JAVA -> DATA TYPES -> LONG
## SUMMARY
> [!summary]-
> - 64-bit signed integer, large range
- Useful for big counts

## THEORY
long accommodates very large integers, commonly used for counters exceeding int's limit, timestamps, and scenarios needing more than 32 bits.

## QUESTIONS
> [!tip]- Typical use cases?
> Handling large numeric values like file sizes or system times

> [!warning]- Performance cost?
> Slightly higher than int but important for big values

> [!danger]- Overflow?
> Possible if you exceed 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
