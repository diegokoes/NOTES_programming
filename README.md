# MY OBSIDIAN VAULT FOR PROGRAMMING

> ⚠️ It's a backup of my obsidian notes, they are not formatted to be properly linked and rendered in GitHub. 

> **Why**:
> When I wanna learn about a topic, I search info about it in a mix of a structured/chaotic way, so I end up with what I searched for, and lots of extra stuff I find interesting. This vault is my attempt at placing all that information in a structured way, **that works for me**.

> **How**:
> 99% of the vault I write myself, the only thing I do with AI is create a temporary index for a topic I wanna learn about and I don't know where to start. Those indexes eventually are replaced by an actual structure I wanna stablish for that topic once I start taking notes/learning about it, but I find it useful to have a first quick glance about what topics I can go into inside one subject.

> **Structure**
> - *Assets*: images pasted into notes.
> - *notes*: notes with folders organized by topic. Actual structure doesn't matter much because I mainly use keybinds to quick travel -> index -> topic, or a topic directly, but with the Templater plugin it autocreates notes with a title of the folder so I keep it organized for that (format of the header is # {folderName} > {topic of this note}...
> - *Templates*: my obsidian templates to paste with Templater, I build my notes with three structures, 1: Summary, 2: Theory, 3: Questions. First one for a quick definition of the concept, second one for an indepth view of the concept, and in questions I like to add things that are tricky to remember, or maybe are a good interview question.
