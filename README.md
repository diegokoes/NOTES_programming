# MY OBSIDIAN VAULT FOR PROGRAMMING

> **Why**:
> When I wanna learn about a topic, I search info about it in a mix of a structured/chaotic way, so I end up with what I searched for, and lots of extra stuff I find interesting. This vault is my attempt at placing all that information in a structured way, that works for me.

> **How**:
> 80% of the vault I write myself, the rest is done through AI. If I just let the AI write down information about a topic, that's completely useless to me, I don't retain anything, but I use it to create an initial index note for a topic with different links, and I take it from there.
>
> AI is also used in some notes in their sections for ##theory or ##questions in topics that I don't know much about yet, so I feed different sources (docs, articles) about it, and let that info as a template that I will then dive into editing once I am actually learning the subject.
