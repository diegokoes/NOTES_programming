## DEFINITION
**Official:**
> Hooks are special functions introduced in React 16.8 that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class component.

**Personal:**
>Hooks are like tools that give your function components superpowers. With hooks, you can add state, handle side effects, and tap into lifecycle events—all within a simple function. This makes your components more powerful and your code more organized.
