# JAVA -> DATA TYPES -> ARRAYS
## SUMMARY
> [!summary]
> Arrays hold a fixed number of elements of a single type, accessed by index.

## THEORY
Arrays in Java are objects that store multiple values contiguously. They are zero-based and have a fixed size once created. You can create an array by specifying its type and size:

String[] names = new String[10];

## QUESTIONS
> [!tip]- How can you iterate over an array in Java?
> Using a for loop or an enhanced for loop.

> [!warning]- What happens if you access an invalid index?
> An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.

> [!danger]- Explain the limitations of arrays compared to ArrayList.
> Arrays have a fixed size; ArrayLists can grow dynamically.
