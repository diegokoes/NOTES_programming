## SUMMARY
> [!summary]
> **Application Programming Interface**, the key part being **interface**. If when using a radio, an user doesn't need to know how the eletrical components inside it work to interact with it via the buttons, the same concept of **abstraction** applies to API's as a programmer. An API is for a programmer what a GUI is for an user.

## THEORY

Is a contract of sorts, it defines how it expects to be used, and waht you can expect to recieve using it. A set of tools designed for software developers.

Access to data, and abtstraction of teh implementation, save from creating everything yourself. 

Most ppl talk about web based API's but there are tons of types.

You don't have to know how it's doing things, just how to write an implementation
