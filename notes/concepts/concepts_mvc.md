# CONCEPTS -> MVC

## SUMMARY

> [!summary]
> Is an architectural/design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: a data **Model**,  a presentation of information in the **View**, and a**Controller**. Each architectural component is built to handle specific development aspects of an application. It isolates the business logic and presentation layer from each other.
